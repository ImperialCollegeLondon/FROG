    The one exception is the send string command ("SS"), which, in addition to eliciting
    an immediate ack (or nack) response, also leads to another response being sent when
    the motor has finished moving. Note that while the motor is moving, other commands
    can be sent and even processed, e.g. you can request that another move happens after
    the first is complete.

    All of the reading we do from the device goes via this class, as conceivably the
    magic send string response could be sent at any point after the send string command
    is sent, so reading should be continuous.

    When the magic send string response is received, the async_read_completed signal is
